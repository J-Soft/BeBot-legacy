BeBot was created by Jonas Jax (Blondengy (RK1)) in 2004 with spiritual guidance by Thomas J. Stensås (Khalem (RK1)).

Currently maintained by a small group of dedicated community members with good help from the Anarchy Online community at large.

The following people have written code that have made it into BeBot in one form or another:
	- Akarah (RK1)
	- Bigburtha (RK2) aka Craized
	- Derroylo (RK2)
	- Ebag333 (RK2)
	- Foxferal (RK1)
	- Jackjonez (RK1)
	- Parfet (RK2)
	- Sabkor (RK1)
	- Temar (RK1)
	- Vhab (RK1)
	- Wolfbiter (RK1)
	- Xenixa (RK1)
	- Zacix (RK2)
	- Zarkingu (RK2)
	
Special thanks go out to the best MMORPG community in exsistance and Auno for writing and maintaining the PHP AOChat library.
